                2.Create files: Right-click in a folder and select "New File". A new untitled file will be created.
                3.Open files: Double-click on a file name in the Explorer to open it in the editor.
                4.Rename files/folders: Right-click on a file/folder and select "Rename".
                5.Delete files/folders: Right-click on a file/folder and select "Delete".
                6.Move/Copy files/folders: Drag and drop them within the Explorer view.
               
Settings and Preferences:

Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.

        1. Accessing Settings:

        There are two main ways to open the Settings editor:

                Menu: Navigate to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS).
                Command Palette: Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Preferences: Open Settings" or search for "settings.json".
        2. Customizing Settings:

                The settings editor displays a searchable list of all available settings. You can:

                -Search: Use the search bar to find specific settings by name or keyword.
                Edit Values: Double-click on a setting or use the dropdown menu to change its value.
                Description: Each setting typically includes a description to explain its purpose.

Debugging in VS Code:

Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
        1.Create a Launch Configuration:

            Open the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D).
            Click the "+" icon and select "Launch Configuration".
            Choose a template appropriate for your programming language (e.g., "Python: Current File" for a Python script).
            This creates a launch.json file that defines how your code will be run for debugging. You can adjust the configuration details as needed.
        2.Set Breakpoints:

            Open your code file in the editor.
            Click on the line number where you want to pause execution during debugging. A red dot appears, indicating a breakpoint.
        3.Start Debugging:

            Click the green "Run and Debug" button (play icon) in the Run and Debug view.
            Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut F5.
        4.Debugging Controls:

            Once the program hits a breakpoint, execution pauses.
            Use the debug toolbar or keyboard shortcuts to control debugging:
            Step Over (F10): Execute the current line and advance to the next line.
            Step Into (F11): Step into a function call and pause at the first line of the function.
            Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function and continue execution.
            Continue (F5): Resume program execution until the next breakpoint or program termination.
        Key Debugging Features in VS Code
        VS Code offers a rich set of debugging features to enhance your development workflow:

        *Variables Pane: Inspect the values of variables at different points in your code during debugging. You can expand objects and view their properties.
        *Call Stack: View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current program state. This helps you understand the program flow.
        *Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger under specific conditions (e.g., when a variable has a certain value).
        Console: Interact with your program during debugging by printing messages or evaluating expressions in the integrated terminal.
        *Source Maps: Debug transpiled or minified code (e.g., JavaScript from TypeScript) by using source maps. This allows you to set breakpoints and see the original source code during debugging.
        *Remote Debugging: Debug programs running on remote machines or containers directly from VS Code.

 Using Source Control:

How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

            Integrating Git with VS Code
            Install Git:

            Ensure Git is installed on your system. Download and install it from git-scm.com.
            Verify Git Installation:

            Open a terminal and type git --version to verify the installation.
            Configure Git:

            Set up your Git username and email:
            
            
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
            Open VS Code:

            Launch VS Code and open the folder containing your project.
            Initializing a Repository
            Open the Source Control View:

            Click the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+G (Mac).
            Initialize the Repository:

            Click the Initialize Repository button in the Source Control view. This will create a .git folder in your project directory, setting up a new Git repository.
            Making Commits
            Stage Changes:

            In the Source Control view, you’ll see a list of changed files under "Changes".
            Click the plus (+) icon next to a file to stage it, or click the + icon in the "Changes" section header to stage all changes.
            Enter a Commit Message:

            In the message box at the top of the Source Control view, enter a descriptive commit message.
            Commit the Changes:

            Click the checkmark icon above the message box to commit the staged changes.
            Pushing Changes to GitHub
            Create a GitHub Repository:

            Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Copy the repository URL.
            Add the Remote Repository:

            Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+` or Cmd+ `).
            Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
            
        
            git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

            Push Changes to GitHub:

            Push your local commits to the GitHub repository:
            
            git push -u origin master
            
            This command pushes the master branch to the origin remote and sets origin/master as the default upstream branch.
Submission Guidelines:

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
